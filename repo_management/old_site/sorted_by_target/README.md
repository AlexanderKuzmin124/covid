# Data Sorted by Target

This directory contains pointers to all data submitted to the Exchange, but sorted by Target
Raw files are not placed in this directory and only linked to through:
```
sorted_by_group
└──GROUP_NAME
   └── SUBMISSION_ID
       └── TARGET
``` 

Sort is then done by type of data (`structures`, `algorithms`, etc.), and then by program. 
References to which group contributed the particular item are also included.
