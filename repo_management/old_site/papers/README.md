# Papers

This directory contains the references for any submitted papers referenced in the Exchange.
Raw files are not placed in this directory and only linked to through:
```
sorted_by_group
└──GROUP_NAME
   └── SUBMISSION_ID
       └── TARGET
           └── papers
``` 

When a paper has been written by multiple groups, the paper should be linked under a common group/collaboration name, 
where the `README.md` in this folder should include details about the members of this collaboration.
```

└──COLLABROATION_NAME
   ├── README.md
   └── SUBMISSION_ID
       └── TARGET
           └── papers
``` 

When one group is submitting a publication they are a contributor of, and other groups have contributed 
to this paper but are not aware of this posting, please note this in the `README.md` of the collaboration name.


Any other class of file specifically referenced from the paper will be cross linked.
