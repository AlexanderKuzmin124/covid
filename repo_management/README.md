# Repository Management and Control

This directory exists to house data and files related to the management and logistics of the 
repository itself, not the data contained within. Metadata, repository images, (like the one on 
the root README), etc. are the only things which belong here.

All data regarding the virus itself shall be housed in the other directories.
