The starting structure was prepared based on [PDB 6LU7](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LU7), with `amber99sb-ildn` force field. The system was solvated with water and counter-ions (NaCL) were added so that the system composed of 98,694 atoms in 9.98921 nm length cubic box with periodic boundary conditions
