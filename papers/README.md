# Papers

This directory contains the references for any submitted papers referenced in the Exchange.
Raw files are not placed in this directory and only linked to through:
```
sorted_by_group
└──GROUP_NAME
   └── TARGET
       └── papers
``` 

When a paper has been written by multiple groups, the paper will be linked in both groups by:

```
sorted_by_group
├──GROUP_A_NAME
│  └── TARGET
│      └── papers
└──GROUP_B_NAME
   └── TARGET
       └── papers
```

Any other class of file specifically referenced from the paper will be cross linked.
