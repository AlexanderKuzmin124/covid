    Coarse graied (CG) mappings are generated from the [DSGPM deep learning model.](https://github.com/rochesterxugroup/DSGPM). Chains A,B and C are coarse grained separately. There are  24,23 and 24 mappings of different resolutions respectively. These are generated from the original all-atom [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2FE8) structure.
