name: "Docking-based repurposing study of approved drugs against truncated human ACE2 ectodomain (inhibitor-bound closed state)"
pdbids:
  - 1r4l
proteins:
  - ACE2
organism:
  - human
description: >
  Computational docking of the approved subset of Drugbank + active
  metabolites + investigational compounds of interest against the
  inhibitor-bound (closed-state) ectodomain of hACE2. The receptor has
  been truncated by removing residues distant from the binding site to
  reduce the computational load. 3D conformers were generated from SMILES
  using OpenEye OMEGA with default settings.
