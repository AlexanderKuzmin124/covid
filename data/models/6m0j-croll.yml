name: "SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2: ISOLDE refined model"
pdbids:
  - 6m0j
proteins:
  - spike
  - RBD
  - ACE2
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  Refinement of 6m0j that fixes multiple issues:
  * Adds/extend GlcNAcs in ACE2
  * Fixes backwards His374 (zinc binding site)
  * Corrects incorrect modeling of both zinc binding sites (originally modeled as disulfides)
  * Corrects rotamer adjustments and peptide flips
  See [a complete description](https://github.com/thorn-lab/coronavirus_structural_task_force/blob/master/pdb/surface_glycoprotein/SARS-CoV-2/6m0j/isolde/notes.txt) of the issues remedied by this model.
