name: "Docking-based repurposing study of approved drugs against truncated RdRp"
pdbids:
  - 7BV2
proteins:
  - RdRP
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  Computational docking of the approved subset of Drugbank + active
  metabolites + investigational compounds of interest against the
  inhibitor-bound (remdesivir) RdRp. The receptor has been truncated by
  removing residues distant from the binding site to reduce the
  computational load. 3D conformers were generated from SMILES using
  OpenEye OMEGA with default settings.
