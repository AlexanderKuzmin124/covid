name: SARS-CoV-2 main protease (apo, monomer) for Folding@home simulations
description: > 
  Apo, monomeric Mpro/3CLpro from PDB structure `6lu7` used in Folding@home simulations. 
  Chain A (i.e. a monomer of the protein, without the inhibitor or waters) was extracted from `6lu7` using PyMOL, and protonated and capped (ACE, NME) with Schrodinger's Maestro.
  The protein was solvated in a cubic box with 1 nm padding and 150 mM NaCl using OpenMM 7.4.1.
