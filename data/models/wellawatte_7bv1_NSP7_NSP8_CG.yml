description: >
    Coarse graied (CG) mappings are generated from [DSGPM deep learning model.](https://github.com/rochesterxugroup/DSGPM). Molecules NSP 7 (chain C) and NSP 8 (chains B and D) of the apo nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex are coarse grained separately. There are 10 and 19 mappings of different resolutions respectively. These are generated from the original all-atom [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7BV1) structure.
