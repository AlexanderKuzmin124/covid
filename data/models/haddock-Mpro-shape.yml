name: "Truncated Mpro based on 6Y2F and shape-compliant 3D conformers"
pdbids:
  - 6Y2F
proteins:
  - 3CLpro
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  Computational docking of the approved subset of Drugbank + active
  metabolites + investigational compounds of interest against the
  Main protease (Mpro). The receptor has been truncated by
  removing residues distant from the binding site to reduce the
  computational load. 3D conformers were generated from SMILES using
  OpenEye OMEGA with default settings.
