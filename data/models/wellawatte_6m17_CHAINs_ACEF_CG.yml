description: >
    Coarse graied (CG) mappings are generated from the [DSGPM deep learning model.](https://github.com/rochesterxugroup/DSGPM). Chains A,C,E and F of the RBD/ACE2-B0AT1 complex are coarse grained separately. There are 16,16,12 and 12 mappings of different resolutions respectively. These were generated from the original all-atom [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M17) structure.
