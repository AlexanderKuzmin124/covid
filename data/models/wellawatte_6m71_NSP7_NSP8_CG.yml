description: >
    Coarse graied (CG) mappings are generated from the [DSGPM deep learning model.](https://github.com/rochesterxugroup/DSGPM). Molecules NSP 7 (chain C) and NSP 8 (chains A and B) of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are coarse grained separately. There are 10 and 15 mappings of different resolutions respectively. These are generated from the original all-atom [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M71) structure.  
pdbids:
  - 6m71
proteins:
