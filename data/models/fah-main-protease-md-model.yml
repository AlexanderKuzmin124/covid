name: "SARS-CoV-2 main protease model for MD simulations"
description: >
  Model of the main protease (Mpro/3cl) of SARS-CoV-2 virus.


  Structures used for these simulations were obtained using x-ray crystallography from Diamond Light Source via Tim Dudgeon.


  A directory of all structures used can be found on our AWS bucket using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
    ```bash
      aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/receptor_structures .
    ```
  These conformations were used for all listed simulations pertaining to absolute free energy of protease inhibitors. A detailed database of which receptor was used for each simulation can be found in the dataframe listed in the url field.
