description: >This is a free online repository for sharing GIST/HSA data of COVID19 related protein targets. Currently, we have the GIST/HSA data for 7 targets:Structures 1-5 (SARS-CoV-2 structures) Main Protease (Mpro, 3CLpro): 6LU7 (2.16 Å), 6YB7 (1.25 Å), 6M03 (2.00 Å), 6Y84 (1.39 Å), 6W63 (2.10 Å). Target the substrate binding site of Mpro.Structure 6 (SARS-CoV-1 structure) Helicase (Nsp13): 6JYT (2.80 Å). Target (1) the ADP binding site but discourage (2) the nucleic acids binding site.Structure 7 (SARS-CoV-2 structure) Nsp16 (2’-O-methyltransferase, nsp 10/16): 6W4H (1.80 Å). Target: S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site.
