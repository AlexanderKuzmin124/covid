description: >
  A collection of about 67,000 ANI-CAS Antiviral compounds composed of a unique molecular tautomer per file and multiple conformations per tautomer.
  Every tautomer is optimized for all low laying conformers within approx. 6 kcal/mol windows. Total elative energies and
  partial atomic chargers included for each conformer. Part of the approximately 9 million conformer from this
  and the ANI-CAS Antiviral collection. (~5.3GB zip file comprised of SDF files)
