description: >
    The dataset files contain low-energy conformers and tautomers of 6,433 FDA approved & investigational drugs.
    A collection consists of 32,036 tautomeric structures and ~3M conformers. After extensive sampling, for every tautomer we found low laying conformers within approx. 
    6 kcal/mol window using ANI-2x neural-network molecular potential. The ANI-2x potential is approaching the accuracy of high-level QM calculations 
    (wB97x-D). [DOI: 10.26434/chemrxiv.11819268.v1 ] For each conformer we list total energy, relative energy, and dipole-consistent partial atomic charges.
