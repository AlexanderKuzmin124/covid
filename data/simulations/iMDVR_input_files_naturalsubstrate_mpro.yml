title: Simulation files for docking the SARS-CoV Mpro natural substrate to an Mpro target using NarupaIMD
description: Relevant smulation files in order to set-up a Narupa IMD simulation for docking the N-terminal natural substrate to three different Mpro targets (i) SARS-CoV Mpro, (ii) an Apo SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and (iii) an Inhibitor complexed SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (where the inhibitor was deleted from the active site prior to docking). There are 6 simulations files in total. Documentation detailing how to set up a NarupaIMD simulation using these files can be found [here] (https://gitlab.com/intangiblerealities/narupa-applications/narupa-imd)
