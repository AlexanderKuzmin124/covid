title: Docking of approved drugs against Mpro with a pharmacophore shape model
description: >
    Repurposing study of the approved subset of Drugbank + active metabolites
    + investigational compounds of interest against Mpro. Compounds are
    guided to the binding site using 3D pharmacophore data extracted from a plethora
    of templates available on the PDB and also through the Diamond assay.
    The template compound shapes have been superimposed on the binding pocket
    of 6Y2F which is the receptor that was used for the docking. Ambiguous
    distance restraints are defined between target compound atoms and the
    template shape beads. Docking is performed in vacuum using the OPLS (UA)
    forcefield with a shifting function and a target of 8.5Å for the electrostatic
    energy and a switching function between 6.5 and 8.5Å for vdW energy,
    respectively. Compounds are scored using a scoring function comprised of
    the sum of vdW and electrostatics energies and an empirical desolvation
    potential.
