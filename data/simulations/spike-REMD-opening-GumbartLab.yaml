title: PMF calculations of SARS-CoV-2 spike opening
description: Conformations (~500) along the opening paths of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer with and without glycans as well as with the diproline mutation. Simulation systems were constructed with VMD, equilibrated initially with NAMD, and then used for two-dimensional replica-exchange umbrella sampling. Conformations provided here are taken from the minimum free-energy path between 1-RBD up and down states in each potential of mean force (PMF). Note that each DCD does not represent a continuous simulation trajecotry. Simulations used a 4-fs timestep enabled by hydrogen-mass repartitioning (HMR).
