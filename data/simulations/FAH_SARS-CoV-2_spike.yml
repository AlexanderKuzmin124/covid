title: Trajectories of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Folding@Home
description: All-atom MD simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, simulated using Folding@Home. Simulations were run using either GROMACS or OPENMM and are stored as compressed binary XTC files. The dataset comprises 3 projects, each having a RUN*/CLONE*/result* directory structure. Each RUN represents a unique starting conformation, each CLONE is a unique MD run from the specified starting conformation, and each result is a fragment of the contiguous simulation.
