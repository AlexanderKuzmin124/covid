title: Trajectories of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Folding@Home
description: >
  All-atom MD simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, simulated using Folding@Home. 
  Simulations were run using either GROMACS or OPENMM and are stored as compressed binary XTC files. 
  The dataset comprises 3 projects, each having a RUN*/CLONE*/result* directory structure. 
  Each RUN represents a unique starting conformation, each CLONE is a unique MD run from the 
  specified starting conformation, and each result is a fragment of the contiguous simulation.
  
  *Entire dataset:* To get the raw trajectory files (XTCs) of the whole dataset (7 TB), you can use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid-19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/spike/PROJ14217 .
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid-19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/spike/PROJ14253 .
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid-19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/spike/PROJ14561 .
   ```

   *Topology file:* To pull the PDB topology file, you can download it directly from [this link](https://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SARS-CoV-2/spike/prot_masses.pdb).

  *Markov Model:* In addition to raw trajectories, a polished Markov Model, including representative cluster centers, transition probabilities, and equilibrum populations, can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid-19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/final_models/spike/model .
