title: Docking of approved drugs against Mpro with a geometric shape model
description: >
    Repurposing study of the approved subset of Drugbank + active metabolites
    + investigational compounds of interest against Mpro. Compounds are
    guided to the binding site using 3D shape data extracted from a plethora
    of templates available on the PDB and also through the Diamond assay.
    The template compound shapes have been superimposed on the binding pocket
    of 6Y2F which is the receptor that was used for the docking. Restraints
    are defined between target compound atoms and the template shape beads.
    Docking is performed in vacuum using the OPLS (UA) forcefield with a
    shifting and switching function for vdW and electrostatics energies,
    respectively. Compounds are scored using a scoring function comprised of
    the sum of vdW and electrostatics energies and an empirical desolvation
    potential.
