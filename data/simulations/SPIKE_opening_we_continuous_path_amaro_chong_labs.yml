title: Continuous trajectories of glycosylated SPIKE opening.
description: All-atom MD trajectories from weighted ensemble simulations of glycosylated SPIKE protein, protein + glycans only. PSF, prmtop, DCDs, and WESTPA input files are provided. Starting structure based on model of the full-length spike in the closed state developed by the Amaro lab, which is modeled from 6VXX. Only the head region of the Spike was included in simulations from residues 16-1140.
