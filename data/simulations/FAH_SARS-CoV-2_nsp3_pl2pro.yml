title: Folding@home simulations of nsp3 pl2pro domain
description: >
  All-atom MD simulations of nsp3 pl2pro, simulated using [Folding@Home](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.175430).
  The dataset comprises 4 projects, each having a `RUN*/CLONE*/result*` directory structure.
  Simulations were run using GROMACS (PROJ14589 and PROJ14584) and are stored as compressed binary XTC files.
  Each RUN represents a unique starting conformation, each CLONE is a unique MD run from the
  specified starting conformation, and each result is a fragment of the contiguous simulation.
  PROJ14584 was seeded using [FAST simulations](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00737).


  **Topology files:** The topology used in the trajectories can be downloaded directly here: [PDB](https://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SARS-CoV-2/nsp3_pl2pro/prot_masses.pdb).


  **Entire dataset:**
  The dataset is made available through the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/foldingathome-covid19/) and can be retrieved through the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

  To retrieve raw trajectory files in [gromacs XTC format](http://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.4/online/xtc.html)
  for the whole dataset, you can use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/nsp3_pl2pro/PROJ14589 .
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/nsp3_pl2pro/PROJ14584 .
   ```


  **Markov State Model:** A polished [Markov State Model (MSM)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b12191),
  including representative cluster centers, transition probabilities, and equilibrum populations,
  can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
  Details of how the MSM model was constructed can be found [here](https://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SARS-CoV-2/final_models/nsp3_pl2pro/README.dat).
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/final_models/nsp3_pl2pro/model .
   ```
  MSM cluster centers can be obtained as a gromacs XTC file from this URL: [cluster centers XTC](https://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SARS-CoV-2/final_models/nsp3_pl2pro/model/full_centers.xtc)


  **Discovered cryptic pockets:** Full description of the discovered cryptic pockets
  can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/final_models/nsp3_pl2pro/cryptic_pockets .
   ```


  **Input files:** System setup and input files can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/nsp3_pl2pro/input_files .
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/nsp3_pl2pro/PROJ14584_tpr_files .
   ```


  **FAST simulations:** [FAST simulations](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00737),
  which were used as seeds for Folding@Home
  simulations, can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-cryptic-pockets/SARS-CoV-2/nsp3_pl2pro/FAST_simulations .
