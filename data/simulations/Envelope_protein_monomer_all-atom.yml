title: All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein E in the monomeric form
description: > 
       The trajectories of all-atom MD simulations were obtained based on 4 starting representative 
       conformations from the CG simulation. For each starting structure, there are six trajectories of the E protein: 
       3 with the protein embedded in the membrane containing POPC, and 3 with the membrane mimicking the 
       natural ERGIC membrane (Mix: 50% POPC, 25% POPE, 10% POPI, 5% POPS, 10% cholesterol).
