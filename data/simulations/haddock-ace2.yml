title: HADDOCK docking of approved Drugbank set against human ACE2 ectodomain
description: >
    Repurposing study of the approved subset of Drugbank + active metabolites
    + investigational compounds of interest against human ACE2. Compounds are
    guided to the binding site using restraints extracted from PDB id 1r4l.
    The binding sire residues have been defined using a distance cut-off of
    5Å. Docking is performed in vacuum using the OPLS (UA) forcefield with a
    shifting and switching function for vdW and electrostatics energies,
    respectively. Scaling of intermolecular energies was lowered to 1/1000
    of their original values for the initial rigid-body docking stage to
    allow the compounds to more easily penetrate into the binding pocket.
    Compounds are scored using a scoring function comprised of the sum
    of vdW and electrostatics energies and an empirical desolvation potential.
