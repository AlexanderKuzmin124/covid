description: >
  PDB of cluster centers representing 13 clusters obtained from gREST_SSCR simulations starting from 1Up conformation. This includes clusters represent 1Up conformations(1Ua.pdb, 1Ub.pdb, 1Uc.pdb, 1Ue.pdb, 1Uf.pdb, 1Ug.pdb, 1Uh.pdb, 1Ui.pdb and 1Uj.pdb), clusters for 2Up like conformations (2Ula.pdb and 2Ulb.pdb)and 1Up/open conformation (1U_O.pdb).
