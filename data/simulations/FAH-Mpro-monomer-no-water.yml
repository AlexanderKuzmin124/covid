title: SARS-CoV-2 main protease (apo, monomer) Folding@home simulations
description: >
  This is a dataset containing 5688 trajectories at least 250 ns in length (2.6 ms in total) of SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease (Mpro/3CLpro) in its apo, monomeric form. 
  Water (but not salt) has been stripped from the trajectories, frames are saved every 0.2 ns.
  Simulations were initiated from PDB structure `6lu7`, chain A, after removing the inhibitor and structural waters.
  
  The dataset is organized by Folding@home project number (11743 and 11749) due to the F@h parallelization -- there are no differences in setups between the projects 
  and there is no relation between the identically named files - all trajectories (`CLONE`s) are initialized with random velocities.

  Chain A (i.e. a monomer of the protein, without the inhibitor or waters) was extracted from `6lu7` using PyMOL, and protonated and capped (ACE, NME) with Schrodinger's Maestro.
  Simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble (310 K, 1 atm), in a cubic box with 1 nm padding, 150 mM NaCl, with hydrogen mass repartitioning (4 amu H mass), using `amber14SB` and `tip3p` forcefields.
  OpenMM 7.4.1 was used. System was equilibrated for 5 ns using 2 fs timestep with default OpenMM Langevin integrator,
  then for 1.25 ns using 4 fs timestep with OpenMMTools custom Langevin integrator using `V R O R V` splitting.
  All Folding@home trajectories were then seeded with random velocities from this system.

  The dataset is available through AWS Public Datasets as explained below, as well as Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/d9tm2
  
  The AWS dataset can be accessed through the command line interface (CLI) as follows:  
    1) Install the AWS CLI:  
      `conda install awscli`  
      or  
      `pip install awscli`  
    2) Configure the CLI with your AWS account: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html  
    3) To download the whole dataset (519 GB):  
      `aws s3 sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .`  
    4) To download subsets of the dataset appropriate query terms can be used, e.g.:  
       the first trajectory of project 11743: `aws s3 sync --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone0.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .`
       the first 10 trajectories of project 11743: `aws s3 sync --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone?.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .`
       the first 100 trajectories of project 11743: `aws s3 sync --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone??.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .`

  Note that an AWS account is required to use the CLI. Individual files can also be downloaded without an AWS account as follows: https://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer/11743/run0-clone0.h5
  Data can also be browsed and downloaded in the AWS Management Console at https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer
