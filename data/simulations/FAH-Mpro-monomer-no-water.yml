title: SARS-CoV-2 main protease (apo, monomer) Folding@home simulations
description: >
  Folding@home projects 11743 and 11749 are made available here without solvent, but including salt.
  Both of these projects were initiated from PDB structure `6lu7`, chain A (after removing the inhibitor (i.e. in apo form), as a monomer).
  The split into two projects is simply the result of the architecture of Folding@home, there are no differences in the setups between these projects.
  Please note the identical file names in both projects, there is no relation between the identically named files - all trajectories are initialized with different random velocities.
  Each trajectory is available in the appropriate project folder with trajectory files formatted as `run<RUN>-clone<CLONE>.h5`,
  with `<RUN>` indexing a set of trajectories started from the same conformation (i.e. all trajectories here are `RUN0`)
  and `<CLONE>` denoting different replicates initiated from the same structure but different initial velocities.
  The dataset contains 5688 trajectories - a subset of trajectories longer than 250 ns generated in these Folding@home projects. Frames are saved every 0.2 ns.

  Chain A (i.e. a monomer of the protein, without the inhibitor or waters) was extracted from `6lu7` using PyMOL, and protonated and capped (ACE, NME) with Schrodinger's Maestro.
  Simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble (310 K, 1 atm), in a cubic box with 1 nm padding, 150 mM NaCl, with hydrogen mass repartitioning (4 amu H mass), using `amber14SB` and `tip3p` forcefields.
  OpenMM 7.4.1 was used. System was equilibrated for 5 ns using 2 fs timestep with default OpenMM Langevin integrator,
  then for 1.25 ns using 4 fs timestep with OpenMMTools custom Langevin integrator using `V R O R V` splitting.
  All Folding@home trajectories were then seeded with random velocities from this system.

  The dataset is available through both the Open Science Framework and AWS Public Datasets. Links are provided to GUIs for both below.
  Additionally, the AWS dataset can be accessed through the command line interface (CLI) as follows:
    1) Install the AWS CLI: `conda install awscli` or `pip install awscli`
    2) Configure the CLI with your AWS account: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html
    3) To download the whole dataset (519 GB): `aws s3 sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .`
    4) To download subsets of the dataset appropriate query terms can be used, e.g.:
       the first trajectory of project 11743: `aws s3 sync --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone0.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .`
       the first 10 trajectories of project 11743: `aws s3 sync --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone?.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .`
       the first 100 trajectories of project 11743: `aws s3 sync --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone??.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .`

  Note that both the AWS Console GUI and the CLI require an AWS account. Individual files can also be downloaded without an AWS account as follows: https://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer/11743/run0-clone0.h5
