title: SARS-CoV-2 main protease (apo, monomer) Folding@home simulations
description: >
  This is a dataset containing 5688 trajectories at least 250 ns in length (2.6 ms in total) of SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease (Mpro/3CLpro) in its apo, monomeric form. 
  Water (but not salt) has been stripped from the trajectories, frames are saved every 0.2 ns.
  Simulations were initiated from PDB structure `6lu7`, chain A, after removing the inhibitor and structural waters.
  
  The dataset is organized by Folding@home project number (11743 and 11749) due to the F@h parallelization -- there are no differences in setups between the projects 
  and there is no relation between the identically named files - all trajectories (`CLONE`s) are initialized with random velocities.

  Chain A (i.e. a monomer of the protein, without the inhibitor or waters) was extracted from `6lu7` using PyMOL, and protonated and capped (ACE, NME) with Schrodinger's Maestro.
  Simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble (310 K, 1 atm), in a cubic box with 1 nm padding, 150 mM NaCl, with hydrogen mass repartitioning (4 amu H mass), using `amber14SB` and `tip3p` forcefields.
  OpenMM 7.4.1 was used. System was equilibrated for 5 ns using 2 fs timestep with default OpenMM Langevin integrator,
  then for 1.25 ns using 4 fs timestep with OpenMMTools custom Langevin integrator using `V R O R V` splitting.
  All Folding@home trajectories were then seeded with random velocities from this system.

  The dataset is available through AWS Public Datasets and can be accessed through the command line interface (CLI) as follows:  
    
    1) Install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):  
      ```bash
      conda install -c conda-forge awscli
      ```
      or  
      ```bash
      pip install awscli
      ```  
    2) To download the whole dataset (519 GB):  
      ```bash
      aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .
      ```  
    3) To download subsets of the dataset appropriate query terms can be used, e.g.:  
       the first trajectory of project 11743: 
       ```bash
       aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer/11743/run0-clone0.h5 .
       ```  
       the first 10 trajectories of project 11743: 
       ```bash
       aws s3 sync --no-sign-request --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone?.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .
       ```
       the first 100 trajectories of project 11743: 
       ```bash
       aws s3 sync --no-sign-request --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone??.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .
       ``` 

  Individual files can also be downloaded directly via HTTP, [for example](https://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer/11743/run0-clone0.h5).    
  Data can also be browsed and downloaded in the AWS Management Console [here](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer).  
  Alternatively, the dataset is also available through the Open Science Framework [here](https://osf.io/d9tm2).
