title: Folding@home SARS-CoV-2 main protease (apo, monomer) simulations
description: >
  This is a dataset containing 5688 trajectories at least 250 ns in length (2.6 ms in total)
  of the SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease (Mpro/3CLpro) in its apo, monomeric form with neutral His41 and Cys145.
  Water (but not salt) has been stripped from the trajectories, and frames are saved every 0.2 ns.
  Simulations were initiated from PDB structure [6lu7](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LU7),
  chain A, after removing the inhibitor and structural waters.

  The dataset is organized by Folding@home project number (11743 and 11749) due to the F@h parallelization -- there are no differences in setups between the projects
  and there is no relation between the identically named files - all trajectories (`CLONE`s) are initialized with random velocities.

  Chain A (i.e. a monomer of the protein, without the inhibitor or waters) was extracted from [6lu7](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LU7) using PyMOL, and protonated and capped (ACE, NME) with Schrodinger's Maestro.
  The model can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/coronavirus/blob/master/system-preparation/6lu7_receptor/output/solvated.pdb).
  Simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble (310 K, 1 atm), in a cubic box with 1 nm padding, 150 mM NaCl, with hydrogen mass repartitioning (4 amu H mass), using `amber14SB` and `tip3p` forcefields.
  OpenMM 7.4.1 was used. System was equilibrated for 5 ns using 2 fs timestep with default OpenMM Langevin integrator,
  then for 1.25 ns using 4 fs timestep with OpenMMTools custom Langevin integrator using `V R O R V` splitting.
  All Folding@home trajectories were then seeded with random velocities from this system.

  The dataset is available through the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/foldingathome-covid19/) and can be retrieved through the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
  To download the whole dataset (519 GB):
    ```bash
    aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .
    ```
  To download subsets of the dataset appropriate query terms can be used. For example, to retrieve
    the first trajectory of project 11743:
       ```bash
       aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer/11743/run0-clone0.h5 .
       ```
       the first 10 trajectories of project 11743:
       ```bash
       aws s3 sync --no-sign-request --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone?.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .
       ```
       the first 100 trajectories of project 11743:
       ```bash
       aws s3 sync --no-sign-request --exclude "*" --include "11743/run0-clone??.h5" s3://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer .
       ```

  Individual files can also be downloaded directly via HTTP, [for example](https://fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer/11743/run0-clone0.h5).

  If you have an AWS account, data can also be browsed and downloaded via the [AWS Management Console(https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/fah-public-data-covid19-moonshot-dynamics/SARS-CoV-2_main_protease_monomer).

  This dataset is also available through the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/d9tm2).
