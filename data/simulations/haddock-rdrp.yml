title: Docking of approved drugs against RdRp
description: >
    Repurposing study of the approved subset of Drugbank + active metabolites
    + investigational compounds of interest against RdRp. Compounds are
    guided to the binding site using restraints extracted from PDB id 7BV2.
    The binding sire residues have been defined using a distance cut-off of
    5Ã…. Docking is performed in vacuum using the OPLS (UA) forcefield with a
    shifting and switching function for vdW and electrostatics energies,
    respectively. Scaling of intermolecular energies was lowered to 1/1000
    of its original value to allow the compounds to more easily penetrate
    into the binding pocket. Compounds are scored using a scoring function
    comprised of the sum of vdW and electrostatics energies and an
    empirical desolvation potential.
