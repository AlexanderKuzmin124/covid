title: Simulations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 possessing different patterns of glycosylation
description: Two-microsecond trajectories of the receptor-binding domains from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to the human receptor, ACE2 with two distinct glycosylation schemes (three replicas each, joined in a single DCD file for each scheme) and with no glycans (two replicas each). Simulation systems were constructed with VMD, equilibrated initially with NAMD, and then run for 2 µs each with Amber16. Simulations used a 4-fs timestep enabled by hydrogen-mass repartitioning (HMR).
