target: viral fusion
description: >
  After the S1 subunit is cleaved from the spike protein,
  S2 rearranges itself, bringing two heptad repeats in close,
  stable proximity to form a 6 helical coiled coil known as
  the fusion core. The formation of the fusion core is thought
  to drive viral-host membrane fusion.
