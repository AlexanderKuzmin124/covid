target: host immune response 
description: > 
certian mechanisms allow viruses to avoid host immune response 
such as removal of ISG15, a ubiquitin like protein thatâ€™s conjugated to 
intracellular proteins post interferon activation and involved in cell-to-cell 
signaling and heightened immune response. Removal of such tags and disruption of 
signal cascades allow infected cells to avoid apoptotic signals.
