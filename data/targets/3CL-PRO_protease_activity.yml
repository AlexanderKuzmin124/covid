target: "3CL-PRO protease activity"
description: >
  3CL-PRO (main protease, M-PRO, etc) is a viral cysteine protease
  responsible for maturation of the viral polyprotein, necessary for
  infection. Target of many drug discovery campaigns. 3CL-PRO is an
  obligate dimer, although many drug design efforts just use a monomer
  structure.
protein:
  - 3CL-PRO
therapeutic: small molecule
