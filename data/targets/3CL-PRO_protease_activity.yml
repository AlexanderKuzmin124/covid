target: "3CL-PRO protease activity"
name: Inhibition of 3CL-PRO protease activity
description: >
  3CL-PRO (main viral protease, Mpro, 3CL-like protease) is a viral cysteine protease
  responsible for maturation of the viral polyprotein by cutting in ~10 positions,
  rendering it necessary for infection.
  Inhibiting protease activity via active site inhibition is likely a viable approach to
  drug discovery.
  As 3CL-PRO is an obligate dimer, inhibiting dimerization may also be a viable route
  to potential therapeutics.
proteins:
  - Mpro
therapeutic_modalities:
  - small molecule
