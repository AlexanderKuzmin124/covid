Virus (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV), Validated Host validated, and Presumed Host presumed based 
protein. Validated proteins are known essential host genes or interactions. The presumed are implicated host proteins 
that arise from analyses, but have not been universally agreed upon. 

Data classification:

- **Structural data**: data defining protein structures determined by experimental methods and referenced via a unique PDB ID.
- **Models**: structural data derived/refined from multiple data sources and prepared for different tasks such as docking, molecular dynamics, free energy perturbation, virtual screening, etc. These are effectively ready to go constructed molecular systems which can be used as initial input for myriad scientific research techniques.
- **Simulations**: datasets associated with molecular simulation method(s) e.g. thermodynamic data, input/output files, trajectories, etc. necessary to run, reproduce, or extend the simulation.
