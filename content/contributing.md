## Contributing

The exchange gladly accepts any of the above types of data (and others if you propose a schema). 
Simply open a PR with the data you wish to submit following the Schema in each of the `/data/{TYPE}/README.md` files.
Data is submitted as YAML files into the `/data/{TYPE}/README.md` directory.

A new YAML file should be created for *every* new piece of data.

This structure is subject to change, but all changes will be made by a maintainer and the instructions 
updated accordingly.
